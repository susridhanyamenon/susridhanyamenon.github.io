### Know Me
I'm a data scientist in the fintech ecosystem specialising in banking, capital markets and global economic affairs. I interest myself in breaking news, investment research and thought leadership that drives action. When not storytelling with theories, events or data or brainstorming for novel solutions for new problems in the financial markets, I can be found puzzling and socialising at a distance in my niche. 
### Read Me
Besides scripting at my internet publishing company where I curate all the hot happenings in business and industry and make available insightful reports and articles on the unmissable, I publish starter code for financial big data analytics and visualisation projects like digitising the process of market information extraction from a combination of spreadsheets and manual workflows to cloud based artificially intelligent projects based on real time data on assets. I also write books detailing things I have learnt from my experience in structuring financial management problems into models, which are mathematical or statistical representation of reality, allowing me to manipulate its parameters and variables so as to generate solutions. My research interests focus on general finance, risk management and trading and market microstructure and so, my papers explore ways to make the everyday journey through the maze of market data hassle free using quantitative analysis.
