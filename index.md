### Know Me
I'm a data scientist in the fintech ecosystem specialising in banking, capital markets and global economic affairs. I interest myself in breaking news, securities research and thought leadership that drives action. When not entrepreneuring for providing novel solutions for noveau problems in the financial markets or storytelling with theories, events or data, I can be found clocking hours as a professor of practice to keep a pulse on what's happening in academics and bridging its gap with the industry.

Besides creating comprehensive financial data and analytics solutions at my internet data platform company, where I also curate blog posts on all the top gen in the realm of the international economy and financial market as well as author learning content on tools and technologies in the field of digital finance, I am also passionate about taking up assignments on discovering the evolution and future of the financial and economic aspects of the world.
