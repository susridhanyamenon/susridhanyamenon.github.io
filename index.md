### Know Me
I'm a data scientist in the fintech ecosystem specialising in banking, capital markets and global economic affairs. I interest myself in breaking news, securities research and thought leadership that drives action. When not storytelling with theories, events or data or brainstorming for novel solutions for new problems in the financial markets, I can be found puzzling and socialising at a distance in my niche. 
### Read Me
Besides scripting at my internet publishing company where I curate all the hot happenings in the realm of financial decision making and make available insightful reports and articles on the unmissable, I publish starter code for financial big data analytics and visualisation projects and content on technologies I am passionate about. I also write books detailing things I have learnt from my experience in structuring financial management problems into mathematical or statistical representations of reality a.k.a. models that allow me to manipulate its parameters and variables so as to generate solutions. My research interests focus on general finance, risk management and trading and market microstructure and accordingly my papers explore ways to make the everyday journey through the maze of market data hassle free using quantitative analysis.
