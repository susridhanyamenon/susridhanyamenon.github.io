### Know Me
I'm a data scientist in the fintech ecosystem specialising in banking, capital markets and global economic affairs. I interest myself in breaking news, investment research and thought leadership that drives action. When not storytelling with theories, events or data or brainstorming for novel solutions for new problems in the financial markets, I can be found puzzling and socialising at a distance in my niche. 
### Read Me
Besides scripting at my internet publishing company where I curate all the hot happenings in business and industry and make available insightful reports and articles on the unmissable, I publish starter code for financial data science and visualisation projects. I also write textbooks detailing things I have learnt from my experience in digitising the process of market information extraction from a combination of spreadsheets and manual workflows to state of the art cloud based artificially intelligent models based on real time data on assets. My research interests focus on general finance, risk management and trading and market microstructure and so, my papers explore ways to make the everyday journey through the maze of market data hassle free using quantitative analysis.
