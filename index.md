### Know Me
I'm a data scientist in the fintech ecosystem specialising in banking, capital markets and global economic affairs. I interest myself in breaking news, securities research and thought leadership that drives action. When not storytelling with theories, events or data or brainstorming for novel solutions for noveau problems in the financial markets, I can be found puzzling and socialising in my niche in the metaverse. 
### Read Me
Besides transcribing at my internet data platform company where I curate all the hot information in the realm of financial decision making and make available illuminating reading material on the unmissable, I author content including programming and ethics codes on technologies in the field of digital finance that I am passionate about. I also write books detailing things I have learnt from my experience in structuring financial management problems into mathematical or statistical representations of reality, or simply put models that allow me to manipulate its parameters and variables, so as to generate solutions. My research interests focus on general finance, risk management and trading and market microstructure and accordingly my papers explore ways to use quantitative analysis to make the everyday journey through the maze of market data hassle free.
